# Readme CR52: Trends in Men's Gender Attitudes

## Coding variables
The codevars.do file can be used to construct the various measures used in [DHS Comparative Report #52:Trends in Men's Gender Attitudes: Progress, Backsliding, or Stagnation?](https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-cr52-comparative-reports.cfm?csSearch=1097642_1). 

The resulting IR coded file for each included survey was used to examine levels and trends for men's responses questions related to five indicators reflecting their gendered attitudes, preferences and behaviors. Men's responses were then compared to women's responses to the same items (with one exception) for a selection of countries with at least three surveys conducted since 2000.

The analysis was conducted in two stages. In the first, we focused only on men, comparing patterns of change across countries and testing the statistical significance of these changes. In the second, we compare men and women's patterns for the same indicators (with one exception).

### The five outcomes used for the examination of men's levels and trends in the first stage are:
  1. Agreement with justifications for intimate partner violence (by husbands towards wives)
  2. Women's involvement in household decisions (major household purchases)
  3. Women's sexual autonomy (refusal of sex as justification for violence)
  4. Women's contraceptive use (agreement that this is 'women's business')
  5. Son preference (preferring an ideal number of sons that is higher than the ideal number of daughters)

The code for some of these indicators and many others can also be found in the [DHS Program Code Share Library Stata Repository](https://github.com/DHSProgram/DHS-Indicators-Stata).
 
## Comparison of men and women's gender attitudes, preferences and behaviors
Six countries were selected to examine how men and women's gendered attitudes changed over time and how these compared to each other. The selection was done based on the level of inequitable views held by men in the first available survey, with Ethiopia and Uganda classified as 'High', Ghana and Zambia as ‘medium’ and Indonesia and Rwanda. With the exception of the indicator for women's contraception, which was only available for men, all the indicators examined in the first stage were also used in this stage.

In both stages, statistical tests were conducted to determine if the change between different surveys in the same country was statistically significant. In the second stage, statistical tests were also conducted to determine if the differences in levels observed between men and women in individual countries was statistically significant.
