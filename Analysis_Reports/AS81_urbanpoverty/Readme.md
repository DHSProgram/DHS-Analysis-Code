# Readme AS81: Urban poverty study

The code in the urbpov_code.do file can be used to construct the urban poverty measure used in the [DHS Analytical Study #81: Urban Poverty and Child Health Indicators 
in Six African Countries with DHS Data](https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-AS81-Analytical-Studies.cfm). 

The resulting HR coded file can be merged with other file types (IR, KR, BR, PR, etc.) to study associations between urban poverty and standard DHS Indicators.
